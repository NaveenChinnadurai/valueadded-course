                <p>Coffee preparation is the process of turning coffee beans into a beverage. While the particular
                    steps vary with the type of coffee and with the raw materials, the process includes four basic
                    steps; raw coffee beans must be <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a>, the <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a> coffee beans must then be <a href="grinding.html">ground</a>, the <a href="grinding.html">ground</a> coffee
                    must then be mixed with hot water for a certain time (brewed), and finally the liquid coffee must be
                    separated from the used grounds.</p>

            <p>Coffee is usually <a href="brewing.html">brewed</a> immediately before drinking. In most areas, coffee may be purchased
                unprocessed, or already roasted, or already <a href="roasting.html">roasted</a> and <a href="grinding.html">ground</a>. Coffee is often vacuum packed to
                prevent oxidation and lengthen its shelf life.

            We're a little depressed. Coffee solves all these problems in one delightful little cup.
